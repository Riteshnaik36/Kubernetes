Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

Control panel or also called as Master Node: 
------------------------------------------------
The Master Node is the central part of a Kubernetes cluster, responsible for managing the cluster's operations and controlling everything. 
It includes several important components.

  a. API Server
  ---------------------
          The API Server is the main point where all administrative tasks are handled and acts as the central control for the entire cluster. 
          It provides the Kubernetes API, which allows users and other parts of the system to communicate with and manage the cluster.


 
b. controller Manager
  ---------------------
          The Controller Manager makes sure the cluster is in the desired state by ensuring that the actual setup matches the intended configuration. 
          Even though each controller works as a separate process, they are combined into one program to make things simpler.
          There are many types of controllers. Some examples include:
          - Node controller: Detects when nodes go down and takes action.
          - Job controller: Watches for jobs (one-time tasks) and creates Pods to complete them.
          - EndpointSlice controller: Manages EndpointSlice objects, linking Services and Pods.
          - ServiceAccount controller: Creates default ServiceAccounts when new namespaces are created.

what is readiness probe? 
A Readiness Probe in Kubernetes is used to check if a container is ready to handle traffic. It helps Kubernetes know when a container has finished starting up and is fully prepared to serve requests.

If the readiness probe fails, Kubernetes will stop sending traffic to that container until the probe succeeds, ensuring that only healthy and ready containers handle requests. 
This prevents users from getting errors or bad responses while the application is still initializing or not fully ready.


















































Liveness vs. Readiness Probes:
--------------------------------
Liveness Probe: 
         Detects when a container is stuck or unhealthy and needs to be restarted.
Readiness Probe: 
         Determines when a container is ready to accept traffic. 
         If a readiness probe fails, Kubernetes will stop routing traffic to the container, but it wonâ€™t restart the container.
